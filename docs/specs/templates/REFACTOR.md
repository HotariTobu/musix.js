<!-- What is being refactored? (1-2 sentences) -->

## Background & Purpose

<!-- Why is this refactoring needed? -->

## Current Structure

<!-- How is the code currently structured? -->

## Proposed Structure

<!-- How will the code be structured after refactoring? -->

## Scope

<!-- What files/modules will be affected? Each item must have a unique ID for progress tracking -->

- [ ] SC-001: File/module 1
- [ ] SC-002: File/module 2

## Breaking Changes

<!-- Are there any breaking changes? If yes, list them. -->

None / List breaking changes

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Define acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then (GWT) format.
Each criterion must have a unique ID (AC-XXX) linked to a scope item (SC-XXX).

### AC-001: [Linked to SC-001, Behavior Unchanged]

- **Given**: [Existing usage pattern]
- **When**: [Action performed using refactored code]
- **Then**:
  - Output is identical to before refactoring
  - All existing tests pass

### AC-002: [Linked to SC-001, Code Quality]

- **Given**: Refactoring is complete
- **When**: Code is reviewed
- **Then**:
  - [Specific improvement 1, e.g., "Cyclomatic complexity reduced"]
  - [Specific improvement 2, e.g., "Code duplication eliminated"]
