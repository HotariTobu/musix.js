# Implement Based on Specification

Specification: $ARGUMENTS

## Task

1. Read the specified specification file from `docs/specs/`
2. Analyze the specification content and create an implementation plan
3. Implement according to the requirements in the specification:
   - Implement type definitions and interfaces from the API Design section
   - Create code that meets functional requirements
   - Implement error handling according to the Error Handling section
4. Create tests based on the Test Requirements section
5. After implementation, update the requirements checklist in the specification

## Guidelines

- Do not implement features not described in the specification
- Strictly follow the type definitions in the specification
- Tests must cover the test requirements in the specification
- If unclear points in the spec are found during implementation, confirm before implementing

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Confirm the following before implementation:
- [ ] Is the specification up to date?
- [ ] Are all requirements clear?
- [ ] Are dependencies resolved?
